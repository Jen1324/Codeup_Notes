# Hashmarks create headings. 
## This is a sub-heading.

1. List 1 
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
1. Item 4

Markdown recognizes lists and orders them

* first item
* second item
  *sub item a
  *sub item b

// --- three dashes by itself makes a straight line across the page. 

// ``` three back tips to seperate code and make it look nice. keeps it in code form.

```
echo "hello world";
if (condition) {
	// do stuff
}
```

Finally, this is a last paragraph with **bold** text and *italics* and `code`.

// Two stars around something makes it bold. One star around something makes it italic.
